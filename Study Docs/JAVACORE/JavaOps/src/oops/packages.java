//object class - predefined class from java like notifyall(),wait(),boolean equals(),tostring() etc

// PACKAGES ARE CONTAINERS THAT ARE USED TO KEEP THE CLASS NAME SPACE COMPARTMENTALIZED...
//like in package if a class is list then if you creatte same name another class then it collide thus package dont allow it
//Basically package is used to maintain the name space uniqueness ..only package classes have knowledge of each other outer pack
// nothings happen
//inerface just like abstract class  but with a additionall feature that a class can implement more than one interface

package oops;   //package intialized


public class packages {
public
}
